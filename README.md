# Stellar Name Service

Stellar Name Service (SNS) is a blockchain-based system that allows users to register and manage human-readable names (e.g., alice.xlm or mywallet.xlm) instead of long, complex addresses. It eliminates reliance on centralized authorities, enhancing security, censorship resistance, and ownership control.
